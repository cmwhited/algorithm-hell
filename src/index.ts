 * - `inputArray`: [4,3,1,2]
 * - `threshold`: 7
 * Expected outcome:
 * - 2
 * @param inputArray the input array of numbers. used to retrieve unique sets of numbers
 * @param threshold the threshold. the sum of the unique sets of three need to be lower than this value
 * @returns the count of the unique sets of 3 numbers from the input whose sum is less than the threshold
